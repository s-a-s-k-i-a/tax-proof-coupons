# Contributing

Please start with a focused GitHub issue that includes reproduction steps, expected and actual behavior, environment versions, and acceptance criteria.

Development requires PHP 7.4-compatible production code, Composer, and Node.js for WordPress Playground. Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
composer install
composer test
composer lint
./scripts/test-playground.sh
```

Pull requests should reference their issue, add regression coverage for behavior changes, and update user-facing documentation when needed. Releases are performed by maintainers according to `docs/RELEASING.md`.
